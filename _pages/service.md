### Community Outreach with SPS

<!-- The Society of Physics Students (SPS) at the University of Rochester was integral to my academic journey, fostering a strong sense of community within the Physics Department. Recognizing physics as one of the least diverse sciences, my involvement with SPS focused on connecting students, faculty, and the broader community through professional development and outreach activities, aiming to make physics more inclusive and accessible. -->

- Launched an initiative promoting STEM education through interactive DIY activities for students in the Rochester City School District, focusing on underrepresented and low-income communities.
- Led the chapter to receive the Outstanding Chapter Award, placing us among the top 15% of chapters nationwide for our community-building and physics outreach efforts.
- Organized peer tutoring sessions for over 300 students in introductory physics courses, significantly enhancing academic support during the transition to online learning.
