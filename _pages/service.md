### Leadership & Outreach

**Society of Physics Students (SPS), University of Rochester**  
*President (2021-2022), Secretary (2020-2021)*

The Society of Physics Students (SPS) at the University of Rochester was integral to my academic journey, fostering a strong sense of community within the Physics Department. Recognizing physics as one of the least diverse sciences, my involvement with SPS focused on connecting students, faculty, and the broader community through professional development and outreach activities, aiming to make physics more inclusive and accessible.

- Launched STEM education program bringing interactive DIY physics experiments to Rochester City School District students—turning "scary physics" into hands-on fun
  
  (More on how we decided to do outreach with city schools [here](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/16d7K25ReF/))

- Organized peer tutoring for 300+ students struggling with introductory physics during the pandemic transition
- Led our chapter to receive the Outstanding Chapter Award (top 15% nationally) for community impact
