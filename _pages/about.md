Hi!! I'm Vashisth (people call me Vash as well). I'm a second-year Master's student in the ECE Dept at CMU focusing on AI. Previously, I studied Mathematics and Physics at the University of Rochester. I am generally interested in the two broad categories of research: improving LLM performance in reasoning and data scarce areas, improving LLM inference. To this end, I am currently exploring a more model aware, active synthetic data generation strategy. 

I have been fortunate to have worked with some amazing people. I currently work with the amazing mentors [Clara Na](https://clarasna.com/) and [Lucio Dery](https://ldery.github.io/#) under Professor [Emma Strubell](https://strubell.github.io/)'s lab. Previously, I worked with Professor [Beidi Chen](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/beidic/) on using speculative decoding to improve throughput and latency, self-speculation by using weight, activation, and contextual sparsity. 

My research journey started with Professor [Segev BenZvi](https://www.pas.rochester.edu/~sybenzvi/) at the University of Rochester, where I worked on ML algorithms to identify supernovae in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. I also worked with Professor [Machiel Blok](https://labsites.rochester.edu/bloklab/team/) on quantifying noise in super conducting qubits.

During my summers, I also have had the pleasure to work at **Los Alamos National Laboratory** with incredible Dr. [Malcolm Boshier](https://www.matterwaveoptics.eu/FOMO2024/malcolm-boshier/) working on algorithms to optimize experimental quantum systems. I also worked as a Quantitative Research Intern at Mana under the mentors [Max Novendstern](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxnovendstern/) and [David Kaufman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidwkaufman/).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
