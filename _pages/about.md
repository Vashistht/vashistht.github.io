Hi! I'm Vashisth (people call me Vash as well). I'm a second-year Master's student in the ECE Dept at CMU focusing on AI. In my undergrad, I studied Mathematics and Physics at the University of Rochester.  I am generally interested in two broad categories of research: *improving LLMs in reasoning and data-scarce areas, and optimizing LLM inference. Currently, I'm exploring model-aware, active synthetic data generation*.

I have been fortunate to work with some amazing people across physics, math, and AI. I currently work with mentors [Clara Na](https://clarasna.com/) and [Lucio Dery](https://ldery.github.io/#) in Professor [Emma Strubell](https://strubell.github.io/)'s lab. Previously, I worked with Professor [Beidi Chen](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/beidic/) on using speculative decoding to improve throughput and latency, self-speculation by utilizing weight, activation, and contextual sparsity. 

My research began with Professor [Segev BenZvi](https://www.pas.rochester.edu/~sybenzvi/) at the University of Rochester working on [Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument](https://www.desi.lbl.gov) and with Professor [Machiel Blok](https://labsites.rochester.edu/bloklab/team/)  on superconducting qubits.

During my summers, I have had the pleasure to work at **Los Alamos National Laboratory** with Dr. [Malcolm Boshier](https://www.matterwaveoptics.eu/FOMO2024/malcolm-boshier/) on optimizing quantum systems. I also gained experience as a Quantitative Research Intern at Mana under mentors [Max Novendstern](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxnovendstern/) and [David Kaufman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidwkaufman/).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
